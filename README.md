# Long Road Home - Arcanoid Example

This project contains a minimal 2D Arcanoid game written in GDScript for
Godot 4.  Open the project in the Godot editor and run the `main.tscn` scene to
play.

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.  Break all the bricks
without letting the ball fall below the paddle.
